# Day07 Demo: 

## Problem Domain: 

* ASAC coffee house is a new cafe so they are updating their menu 
* There are alot of drinks that they can add to the menu and  it's too time-consuming to hand-code them each time   so They need a better and faster way.

* Each drink should has:
 - name
 - ingredients
 - an image
 - cold
 - hot 
 - price 

* TODO: dynamically generate drink objects using form data
