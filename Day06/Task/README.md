# Task 06:

## Overview:
You will continue building on what you achieved in the last tasks.

## Problem Domain:
You are building a ToDo List Web Application, where the users can display their tasks and check the status for each one.

## Requirements:

1. **Set up your Github Repository:**
   - Continue working on the same `todo-project` repo.
   - Checkout a new branch called `todo-js2` for today's task.
   - Open it in VS code.

2. **Continue adding functionality to your project**:
   - As a user, I would like to answer more questions, so you should add new three (Yes/No) questions.
   - If the input was empty consider the answer is "invalid" string.
   - Consider putting all the answers into an array.
   - Traverse the array and print the items on the console.
   - Confirm that your code is following the single responsibility rule. Each function should only do one thing.
   - All functions and variables should have a meaningful name (use camelCase).

## Submission Instructions:
- When your work is complete and ready for submission, push to the `todo-js2` branch.
- Create a pull request.
- Deploy to the Github pages.
- Submit the pull request and deployed version (Live URL) links.
- Merge `todo-js2` with the main branch.
- What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
- How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
